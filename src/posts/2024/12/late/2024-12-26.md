# Web Tracking prevention

First time encountered this kind of issue. It's a combination of the edge browser at work is controlled by company policy and the configuration is not quite correct.

So the same URL is blocked on one site, but not on another, because the first site is not on the allowed list but the second site is.

Learned some thing new and interesting today about web tracking prevention, the process for finding out the mechanism behind the issue is full of fun.
